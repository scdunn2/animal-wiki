  <p>The meerkat is a small mongoose like creature, measuring only 16 inchs from head to tail. Their pelts are generally sand colored with small brown stripes along the back. The fur around their bellies is rather sparse and reveals black skin underneath. A meerkat will often sunbathe on their back revealing the fleshy spot. Around their eyes are dark circles which keep the sun's glare from impacting their vision. Meerkats also have long claws that they use to dig the burrows they call home. They are quadrapeds, usually walking on 4 legs, but have the unique ability to stand up on their hind legs for extended periods of time.

    <div class="desertimg"><img src="assets/desert.jpg"></img></div>
  <p>  The Kalahari desert is a dry, arid landscape identifiable by its red sand. It is a "semi-desert", with huge tracts of excellent grazing after good rains, the Kalahari supports more animals and plants than a true desert, such as the Namib Desert to the west. There are small amounts of rainfall and the summer temperature is very high. The driest areas usually receive 110–200 millimetres (4.3–7.9 in) of rain per year,[1] and the wettest just a little over 500 millimetres (20 in). The surrounding Kalahari Basin covers over 2,500,000 square kilometres (970,000 sq mi) extending further into Botswana, Namibia and South Africa, and encroaching into parts of Angola, Zambia and Zimbabwe. </p>

  <div class="burrowimg"><img src="assets/burrow.jpg"></img></div>
<p>  In order to remain cool in these conditions meerkats live in a system of tunnels and burrows scattered all throughout their territory. In areas that are commonly foraged, meerkats will often make small escape tunnels known as “bolt holes”
</p>

<div class="Behavior" id="Behavior"></div>

  <h2> Behavior </h2>
    <div class="family2img"><img src="assets/family.jpg"></img></div>
  <p>Meerkats live in groups known as “mobs” or “gangs”. Their societies are matriarchal. Animals from within the same group will often groom
each other to strengthen social bonds. The alpha pair will often scent mark subordinates of the group to express their
authority, and such actions are usually followed by the subordinates licking the faces of, and grooming, the alphas. These
actions are also usually practiced when members of the group are reunited after a short period apart. Most meerkats
within the same group are all siblings and offspring of the alpha pair. </p>

<p>Meerkats have scent pouches below their tails and rub these pouches on rocks and plants to mark their territory. The territories of different groups often overlap, resulting in constant disputes. When the two groups meet for a face-off, the results can be tragic. Meerkats are vicious fighters that often kill each other in these skirmishes. Knowing the high cost of an all-out war, they try to avoid serious conflict if possible. Usually, a lot of aggressive posturing and bluffing precedes any physical contact. These wars can look a bit like the human battles of yesteryear: both sides line up across a field and, at the right moment, charge forward with leaps and bounds, holding their tail rigid and straight up in the air. Every third or fourth leap, they arch their back and thrust their rear legs backward like a bucking bronco. Whichever side has the most threatening display in their charge may “psych out” the opponents. Yet meerkats groups have been known to accept outside individuals into their mob, and they sometimes share their burrows with yellow mongooses. </p>

<div class="family2img"><img src="assets/guard.jpg"></img></div>
<p>Unfortunately for meerkats, they are a tasty treat for larger carnivores, especially jackals, eagles, and falcons. However, meerkats have developed a way to forage in relative safety: adults take turns acting as guard while the others can look for food without worries. The guard climbs to the highest rock, termite mound, or bush he or she can find, stands upright on two legs, and then announces the beginning of guard duty with a specialized call. A low, constant peeping, known as the watchman's song, is made when all is well.</p>

<p>If a predator is spotted, the guard alerts the others with a bark or whistle. There are different calls for land predators and for those coming from the air. When the alarm is raised, the meerkats usually run for the nearest hole, called a bolt hole. These are special tunnels with wider openings designed to hold a crowd of meerkats at once. Meerkats memorize the locations of thousands of bolt holes within their territory and are able to run to the closest one at a moment's notice. A meerkat mob sometimes stirs up dust to create a cover, or the mob may stand together to look larger, acting fierce to scare off the predator.

  <h2> Pop Culture </h2>
  <br>
    <p> <i><strong>Meerkats have been subject to numerous cultural depictions, and have featured in television programmes, films, books, and other media. </p>
</i></strong>

<div class= "manor"> <img src="assets/manor.jpg"></img> </div>
<p> The British television series <i>Meerkat Manor</i>, produced by Oxford Scientific Films, features wild meerkats studied by the staff of the Kalahari Meerkat Project[1] and primarily focused on a group of meerkats called the Whiskers. The show, which aired on Animal Planet, premiered in 2005, and the final episode aired in 2008. The series, which uses narration and traditional nature documentary style footage, has been described as a "reality soap"[2]; the meerkats are given names and described as having human traits - for example, individual meerkats are characterised as being "courageous" or "caring".[3] A television movie serving as a prequel, Meerkat Manor: The Story Begins, was released in 2008, detailing the life of the Flower, who was the dominant female meerkat of the Whiskers. Unlike the TV series, the filmmakers did not use actual footage of the Whiskers group, rather, they primarily used various untrained wild meerkat "actors" to portray those in the story[4], which was based on the research notes of the Kalahari Meerkat Project. </p>

<p> The 1987 BBC Wildlife on One documentary <i>Meerkats United</i>, presented by David Attenborough, played a large role in introducing the meerkat species to public consciousness in Britain.[5] It was once voted the best wildlife documentary of all time by BBC viewers.[5] A follow-up, Meerkats Divided, aired in 1996.[6]
</p>
<div class= "watchogimg"> <img src="assets/watchog.png"></img> </div>
  <p>The Pokémon species Watchog, first introduced in Pokémon Black and White, resembles a meerkat.[21][22] In official sources, each Pokémon species is given a category describing it; Watchog's category is "Lookout Pokémon".[23]
  </p>
<p>The television advertising campaign <i>Compare the Meerkat</i> is popular in the United Kingdom and Australia.[7][8] The campaign promotes the price comparison website comparethemarket.com in the UK, and comparethemarket.com.au in Australia. The campaign was launched in 2009 in the UK, and centers around the anthropomorphic character Aleksandr Orlov (voiced by Simon Greenall[9]), an aristocratic Russian meerkat. Other meerkat characters have featured in the advertisements, such as Aleksandr's sidekick Sergei.[10][11] </p>

<p>The Neighbourhood Watch scheme in the United Kingdom has used meerkat imagery in its branding and posters.[12] </p>

<div class= "timon"> <img src="assets/timon.jpg"></img> </div>
<p>
Timon, a character from Disney's The Lion King franchise, is an anthropomorphic meerkat.[13]
</p>
<p>
In the book Life of Pi and its film adaptation, the floating island is inhabited by tens of thousands of meerkats[14], in an environment and grouping unlike real meerkats.
<p>
Meerkats appear in Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel. The chipmunk character Theodore is shown to be a fan of the TV series Meerkat Manor[25]; this later influences the plot of the film when, after running away from home, Theodore goes to a zoo and tries to join the family of meerkats there.[26]
  </p>
  <div class= "alvin"> <img src="assets/alvin.jpg"></img> </div>
<p>Billy, the protagonist of the German animated film Animals United, is an anthropomorphic meerkat.[15]
<p>The 2008 wildlife drama film The Meerkats, produced by BBC Films and The Weinstein Company, uses footage of wild meerkats combined with narration written by Alexander McCall Smith. James Honeyborne directed the film, and is also credited for the story. Paul Newman, in his final film credit, provided the voice of the narrator.[16][17] Guardian reviewer Philip French commented that the portrayal of the meerkats was "more Disney-anthropomorphic than Attenborough-authentic."[18]
</p>
<p>A rolling version of the popular GNU/Linux distribution Ubuntu was called "Maverick Meerkat". It was released in October 2010.[19][20]
</p>
<p>Komiya, a character from Sanrio's anime series Aggretsuko, is an anthropomorphic meerkat.[24]
